                <h3>Ovaries</h3>
                <p> Ovaries are like magical egg factories in your body, where eggs are stored and released each month.
                    They're also superheroes because they produce important hormones that help you grow big and strong!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fallopian Tubes</h3>
                <p>These are like cozy slides that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. It's where the magic
                    happens when an egg meets sperm for a chance to create a new life!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cervix</h3>
                <p>The cervix is like a gatekeeper to your uterus, which opens and closes during your menstrual cycle
                    and childbirth. It's super smart because it protects your uterus like a gentle hug!</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Uterus</h3>
                <p>Your uterus is a cozy nest where a baby grows if a sperm meets an egg and makes a baby. It's strong
                    and stretchy, ready to hold and nurture new life!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Vagina</h3>
                <p>The vagina is like a comfy tunnel that connects the outside world to your uterus. It's flexible and
                    self-cleaning, making sure everything stays healthy and happy down there!</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

                this bleeding usually lasts 3-5 days. It is a normal part of the menstrual cycle. A kid can experience
                their first period as early as 9 years of age and as late as 16 years. Each cycle lasts 28 days,
                however, this can vary from person to person. <a

                <h3>Managing discomfort</h3>
                <p>Managing discomfort during your period can be as cute as cuddling up with a cozy heating pad or doing
                    a little dance to lift your spirits. Sip on some soothing herbal tea or treat yourself to your
                    favorite snacks to bring a smile to your face and help ease any cramps.</p>

                <h3>Emotional well-being</h3>
                <p>Taking care of your emotional wellbeing during your period can be like giving yourself a warm hug.
                    Try journaling your feelings in a sparkly notebook, cuddling up with a fluffy blanket, or having a
                    movie marathon with your favorite snacks. Remember, it's okay to pamper yourself and take things at
                    your own pace!.</p>
