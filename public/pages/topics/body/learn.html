        <h1>Understanding Girls' Puberty</h1>
        <p>Puberty is a significant stage in every girl's life. Here, we provide detailed information about what changes
            to expect during this transformative period.</p>

        <h2>Physical Changes</h2>
        <div class="physical-images-container">
            <img src="../../../images/learn2.jpg" alt="Physical Change 2">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Development of Breasts</h3>
                <p>One of the first signs of puberty in girls is the development of breasts. This typically starts with
                    small, firm lumps called breast buds under the nipple.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Start of Menstruation</h3>
                <p>Menstruation, or having periods, usually begins about two years after breast development starts. This
                    marks the beginning of reproductive capability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Growth of Body Hair</h3>
                <p>Hair growth in the pubic area and armpits is another sign of puberty. The hair starts out fine and
                    sparse and becomes coarser and darker over time.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Emotional Changes</h2>
        <div class="images-container">
            <img src="../../../images/emotions.jpg" alt="emotional Change 2">
        </div>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Mood Swings and Emotional Variability</h3>
                <p>During puberty, girls might experience mood swings due to hormonal changes. This can lead to feelings
                    of sadness, irritability, or anxiety.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Body Image</h3>
                <p>Girls may become more conscious of their bodies and how they compare to their peers. This increased
                    awareness can sometimes lead to self-consciousness or concern about appearance.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Social Impacts</h2>
        <div class="images-container">
            <img src="../../../images/friends.jpg" alt="Physical Change 2">
        </div>
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Social Circles</h3>
                <p>As girls go through puberty, their social relationships may change. They might seek more independence
                    and start to form new friendships or social circles.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Increased Independence</h3>
                <p>Puberty is a time when girls often explore their identity and personal interests. This increased
                    independence can be a positive step towards becoming more self-assured and confident.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Stages of Puberty!</h1>
        <p>The five stages of puberty in girls, described by the Tanner Scale, outline the physical development from
            childhood to adulthood, encompassing breast development, pubic hair growth, and other key changes.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Tanner stages</h2>
        <div class="physical-images-container">
            <img src="../../../images/learn2.jpg" alt="Physical Change 2">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>First stage</h3>
                <p>Breast development: None; the chest is flat. Pubic hair: None. Growth: Normal childhood growth
                    rate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Second stage</h3>
                <p>Breast development: Small breast buds form under the nipples. Pubic hair: Light, sparse, and
                    straight
                    hair begins to grow along the labia. Growth: Growth spurt begins; increased height and weight.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Third stage</h3>
                <p>Breast development: Breasts become more elevated and extend beyond the areolae. Pubic hair: Hair
                    becomes coarser, darker, and starts to spread. Growth: Continued height growth; peak growth
                    velocity
                    occurs. Other changes: Possible onset of acne; hips start to widen.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Fourth stage</h3>
                <p>Breast development: Breasts become fuller and the areolae become more pronounced.
                    Pubic hair: Hair is adult-like in appearance but does not spread to the inner thighs.
                    Growth: Slower growth rate; nearing final adult height.
                    Menstruation: Menarche (first menstrual period) typically occurs during this stage.
                    Other changes: Continued development of underarm hair and possible voice changes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fifth stage</h3>
                <p>Breast development: Adult breast size and shape are reached; areolae recede to the contour of the
                    breast.
                    Pubic hair: Adult distribution, spreading to the inner thighs.
                    Growth: Growth in height stops.
                    Other changes: Full development of secondary sexual characteristics; reproductive maturity.</p>
